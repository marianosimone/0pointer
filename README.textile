This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

A plain-text blog, without databases and a big infraestructure beneath is not what I want anymore (i tried Blogger and Wordpress).

All the content on this blog is released to the public domain, unless specified. Feel free to download, fork, remix or do WTFYW
