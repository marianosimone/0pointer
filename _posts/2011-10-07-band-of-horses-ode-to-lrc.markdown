Even though I must admit "Cease to Begin" is the only album by "Band of Horses" (an U.S. indie band) that I like, I really think you should listen at least a couple of their songs. 'Ode to LRC' is one of my favourites:

If you liked it, give this tunes a try: "Marry Song", "No One's Gonna Love You", "Detlef Schrempf"
