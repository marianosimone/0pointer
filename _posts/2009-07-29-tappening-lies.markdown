[Tappening](http://www.tappening.com/) is driving a campaing against bottled water, trying to make people to drink tap water. The following is part of a genius marketing idea:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="uploads/tappening_lies_bears.jpg" alt="If bottled water companies can lie, we can too. Bottled water: 98% melted icecap. 2% polar bear tears."/>
</div>

> If bottled water companies can lie, we can too. Find out the truth at tappening.com or spread your own lie at startalie.com. Bottled water: 98% melted icecap. 2% polar bear tears.
