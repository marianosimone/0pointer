I'm a maniac in many aspects... among them is the way I treat my books: I try to open them as little as possible, I don't write on them and I don't fold their pages.

That's why the following quote at a [MoMA](http://www.moma.org/) exhibition about printing got my attention:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="uploads/moma_about_books_as_assets.jpg" alt="An unopened book on a collector's shelf may be in perfect condition, but it has failed to fulfill its mission of reaching a wide audience"/>
</div>

> An unopened book on a collector's shelf may be in perfect condition, but it has failed to fulfill its mission of reaching a wide audience

Since then, I remember myself that books are assets and that they are meant to be used, not just kept near mint
