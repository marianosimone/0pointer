There's been a lot of fuss about this [Cleverbot](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44434584/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/how-cleverbot-computer-chats-human) thing lately. So, I just went to its [webpage](http://cleverbot.com/) and made it fail the Turing Test in a couple of lines (not actually... it might be fooling me into thinking that it IS a machine ¬¬):

 - me: what is kung fu?
 - it: what is life?
 - me: you're not answering my question
 - it: and what is your question?
 - me: what is kung fu?
 - it: your name is Paul Robertson
 - me: no, it's not
 - it: and what's it, then?
 - me: you're not that smart, aren't you?
 - it: that was evil!
 - me: I'm the devil himself.
 - it: Actually, no.
 - me: And who am I, then?
 - it: A machine?
 - me: No I'm not, are you one?
 - it: Yes.
