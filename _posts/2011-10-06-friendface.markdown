[The I.T. Crowd](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-it-crowd) is a hilarious English T.V. show that tells the story about the I.T. department of a company... or the story about two nerds and their boss: a woman that was passing by and ended up as head of department.

In one of the episodes they make fun of FB, explaining what it is and how it works:
