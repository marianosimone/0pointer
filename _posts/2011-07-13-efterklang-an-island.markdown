Efterklang is a Danish indie band which is doing some interesting multi-media material. Today I bought their movie "An Island", in which they return to their home town and play some songs with "common people" using some "uncommon" instruments (like a broomstick or balloons)

One of the most curious facts about the movie is that, when they released it, it was free to download; you only had to organize a "public screening", invite people to watch it and send them a photo (check'em @ [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anisland/))

The following is a performance of "Alike", one of my favorite tunes by them:
