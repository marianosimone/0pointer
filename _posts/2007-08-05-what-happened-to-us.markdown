"[What happened to us?](http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/24)" is an exhibition by Romanian artist [Dan Perjovschi](http://www.perjovschi.ro/) (@[MoMA](http://moma.org/)) in which he draws witty and incisive political images, in response to current events, directly on one wall of the museum.

The following are some of the images I liked the most:

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
