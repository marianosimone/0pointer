[I Wish I Were The Moon](http://www.ludomancy.com/blog/2008/09/03/i-wish-i-were-the-moon) is a love story (kind of three-some) where we have to intervene in subtle ways to get one of the possible endings. Its gameplay is really original and the whole game is completely different to any other I've played so far.
