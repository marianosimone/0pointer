龙神道 / Long Sheng Dao is a Chinese Reggae band that demonstrates that you don't need to be black to play this rhytm and share its philosophy.

"The dragon is the symbol of China. The gods are the source of their resolution, existence and power. The Tao ("the way") comes from the Taoist philosophy of Laozi and points out a certain road or way of thinking."
