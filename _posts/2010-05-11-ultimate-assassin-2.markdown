Basically, there are two types of players (regarding shooters): The "Rambo"-like and the others. I've always been an other, waiting for the right moment to grab a foe silently, without being detected, or restarting a million times from a checkpoint just to finish a level without killing anyone or setting off the alarms (I've spent WEEKS playing [Splinter Cell](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell_%28video_game%29) and [Commandos](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Commandos_%28series%29) when a couple of days would've been enough to finish them)

In [Ultimate Assassin 2](http://www.games121.com/2009/06/ultimate-assassin-2.html), you HAVE to be an other

You can't kill everyone... just the level's "target". The only thing you have to do is find the target without being noticed, kill him and run.
