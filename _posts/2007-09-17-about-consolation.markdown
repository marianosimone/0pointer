Some wise words by a friend of mine:

> Si ven a alguien lamentarse, no se explayen con cientos de explicaciones, lo mÃ¡s probable es que no falte entendimiento, sino que sobre dolor.

(english translation)
> If you see someone mourning, don't try to explain anything; most likely it's not that they lack understanding but that they've got plenty of pain
