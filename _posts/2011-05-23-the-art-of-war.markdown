"The Art of War" is one of those books I always knew I was going to like. Along many other interesting things, I found this:

> **Tactical Dispositions**
> 
> Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old
> first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, 
> and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
> 
> To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands,
> but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
> 
> Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,
> but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
> 
> Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it

There's a lot of wisdom on this words, which we can find in a daily basis. "I know this is wrong, I know how to make it right... but I'm not able to do it"
