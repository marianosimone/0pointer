One of the best voices and one of the best guitarists ever got together to record (after lots of albums as Led Zeppelin) a marvelous record: "No Quarter". This is a reimagination of Zep's work, merged with Middle-Eastern and Moroccan-influenced songs (including instruments such as mandolins, banjos, hurdy gurdies, violins, violas, celos, bodhr√°ns, ouds, dafs, bendirs and didjeridus).

The following is a beautiful interpretation of "Wonderful One".
