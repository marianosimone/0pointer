[Dengue Fever](http://www.myspace.com/denguefevermusic) is a band from U.S.A that has a khmer singer that went to the States to live the "American Dream". You should, at least, give'em a try (it's not easy-listening, though). Aparently, these guys are inspired by the Cambodian psychedelic movement from the 60s-70s that was repressed (or annihilated, to be fair) during the Khmer Rouge period.
