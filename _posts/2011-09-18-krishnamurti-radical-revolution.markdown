The following is a speech by the Indian philosopher [జిడ్డు కృష్ణ మూర్తి (Jiddu Krishnamurti)](http://www.jkrishnamurti.org), which I discovered while watching [Zeitgeist Addendum](http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/)

> We were saying, how very important it is to bring about, in the human mind, the radical revolution. The crisis, is a crisis of consciousness. A crisis that cannot anymore, accept the old norms, the old patterns, the ancient traditions. And, considering what the world is now, with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality, aggression, and so on... Man is still as he was. Is still brutal, violent, aggressive, acquisitive, competitive. And, he's built a society along these lines.
> Jiddu Krishnamurti.

It's astonishing to realize how very much can be said with so little words when you actually believe in what you say.
