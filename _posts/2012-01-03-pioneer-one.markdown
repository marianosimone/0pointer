I just finished watching [Pioneer One](http://pioneerone.tv)'s first season and it's awesome. The story is about an U.F.O. that crashes on Canada and how a group of U.S. Department of Defense agents try to discover what it is while the official posture is that it's related to a terrorist attack.

Its awesomness is not only about the story, but also about how its creators developed it: They filmed the first episode and asked for donations on (VODO)[http://vodo.net/] until they reached their goal. Today, we can watch 6 great episodes, and expect a second season.
