As a reader and a geek, I LOVE digital books, eInk and whatever helps me read better and more! That's why I really liked this "ad" and I think ideas like this one should be spread:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="uploads/lo_que_cambia_es_el_formato_zoom.jpg" alt="the only thing that changes is the format"/>
    <br/>
    <blockquote>the only thing that changes is the format</blockquote>
</div>
