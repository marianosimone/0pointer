Following some links, after watching a couple of “green” movies ([No Impact Man](http://noimpactman.typepad.com/), [Food Inc](http://www.foodincmovie.com/)), I got to “[Abuela Grillo](http://abuegrillo.blogspot.com/)“. It's a short movie of outstanding beauty: visually and musically speaking… and above all, in the message it delivers about the dangers of not allowing nature to continue its course.

This short is and adaptation of an [ayoreo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoreo) myth. The singer is [Luzmila Carpio](http://www.luzmilacarpio.com/), an amazing bolivian singer.
