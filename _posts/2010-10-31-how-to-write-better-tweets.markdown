I've known [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/jakob/) since a friend recommended me to read “[Don’t make me think](http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html)“, by Steve Krug who, in time recommends Jakob's webpage as one of the main usability referents.

Reading his blog, I found [this post](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/twitter-iterations.html) about how to write better tweets, using a simple example and improving it by iterating over its content.

Some of the main recommendations he gives are:

- Use UPPERCASE letters to EMPHASISE keywords
- Don't get to the 140 chars limit, so people can RT and add something
- Give specific info
- Use URL shorteners, but keep in mind that the result should have something to do with the content
- Schedule tweets wisely (keeping in mind your target's time-habits). Tweets are short-lived in people's timelines
