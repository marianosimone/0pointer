[From the Basement](http://fromthebasement.tv) is a strange TV experiment where a band plays alone (in a basement) without audiance nor host...

A lot of bands played their, including [Radiohead](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/radiohead/gallery), [Sonic Youth](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/sonic-youth/gallery), [Iggy and the Stooges](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/iggy-and-the-stooges/gallery), [Band of Horses](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/band-of-horses/gallery), [Raconteurs](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/the-raconteurs/gallery), [Gnarls Barkley](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists/gnarls-barkley/gallery), among [others](http://www.fromthebasement.tv/artists)

If you take a look, you can find outstanding performances like this one:
