[变脸](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bian_lian) (Biàn Liǎn, or "Face-Changing") is a Chinese dramatic art, in which performers change their masks instantly, while moving their arms and heads.

It is said that only 200 people know how to perform this art, and it's a secret that is passed from father to son. It might be one of the best kept magic tricks ever.

The changing is achieved by quickly tearing off, rubbing, or blowing away a mask to reveal another, and the artists can use more than 30 masks in one performance.

变脸's world is reflected in Tian-Ming Wu's "[The King of Masks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115669/)"
