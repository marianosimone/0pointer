It's OK to discriminate: you are selecting and excluding something. You discriminate food that you don't like, for example. The problem is "bad" discrimination, when you exclude without a reason. The "Asociación de Diseñadores Gráficos de Asturias" and the "Escuelas de Arte de Oviedo y Avilés" (Graphic Designers Association from Asturias and Art Schools from Oviedo y Avilés") installed some banners like this one in their cities:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="uploads/diferente.jpg"/>
    <blockquote>i'm a whore, i'm a nigger, i'm a faggot, i'm a moor, i'm a 
<abbr title="Spanish word for a South American">sudaca</abbr>, i'm a woman. You are the one who's different, moron</blockquote>
</div>

The banner is part of a collection named "¿Diferentes?" ("Different?"), designed for [Motiva 2008](http://www.escueladearte.com/Actividades/Motiva/Motiva2008/index.htm) (where you can download the full catalogue)
