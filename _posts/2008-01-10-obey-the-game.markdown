[Obey The Game](http://armorgames.com/play/4987/obey-the-game) has about 10 levels (with objectives like 'Suicide', 'Survive', 'Take the Stairs') that have to be finished in a couple of seconds. There's no 'Retry', if you fail a level, you loose a life if you win three, you get an extra one. The trick is that, in some levels, you have to 'Disobey' the order, and do the opossite. Simple rules, creative gameplay = addictive game!
