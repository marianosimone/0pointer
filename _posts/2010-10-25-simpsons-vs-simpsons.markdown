The classic Simpsons presentation was, for the first time in history, authored by an outsider. And it was no less than [Bansky](http://www.banksy.co.uk/), a graffitti artist from London, who usually writes/paints his work on public spaces such as zoos and museums.

This video is not only interesting because of the author itself, but also because of the self-criticism to the show's production (something that they usually do, but that doesn't cease to amaze me)
